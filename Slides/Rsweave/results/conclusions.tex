The aim of this report was to assess the potential association between the DDE and PCB chemicals with the chance of early delivery. The core of our analysis is built upon two building blocks: the measure adjustment for the level of lipids (calculated with a linear combination between triglycerides and cholesterol), and a bayesian ordinal logistic regression with the three outcomes as a dependent variable (Dangerous preterm, Preterm and At term). We find that the exposures have an adverse  effect that is highly dependent on race. While the effect is strong across the choice of the prior, several further strategies can be still implemented to further check the results. For example, our selection procedure drops the three variable that are mean imputed (the scores). In the future, we should consider a more comprehensive imputation methods, such as MICE. Moreover, we can extend the full model by modeling  the effect of the chemicals in a non-linear way,  as small levels of exposure are likely to have no effect on human health and we expect the effect to stabilize past a certain threshold. Finally, we can further control for the heterogeneity across centers by modeling the response with a hierarchical structure.

This report focuses on the adverse effects of exposures to DDE and PCB chemicals on the chance of premature birth delivery, which may be associated to a weaker health status for the newborn. In particular, we analyze the gestation length in weeks of a sample 2380 women of different race and economic status collected across 11 medical centers. We first divide the women into three groups ("Dangerous preterm", "Preterm" and "At term").  As DDE and PCB are lipophilic substances, we correct their concentration measurement to control for an estimate of the lipids in the blood, and later use these adjusted measures as explanatory variables in a Bayesian ordinal logistic regression model with the women's group as outcome. We find that the effects of the chemicals are essentially race dependent: increases in PCB levels are more detrimental to non-whites, while increases in DDE enhance the odds of a more dangerous delivery on white.
